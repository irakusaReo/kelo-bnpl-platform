# Kelo Codebase Audit Report

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the Kelo codebase, comparing its current state against the original technical blueprint and the "Target End-to-End Flows."

### ✅ Implemented & Working

- **Frontend Scaffolding**: The project has a well-structured frontend built with Next.js and TypeScript, located in the `src` directory.
- **Backend Scaffolding**: A Go backend using the Gin framework is in place (`backend` directory), with a modular structure for different domains.
- **User/Merchant Onboarding UI**: The user interface for registration and login is implemented using NextAuth.js, with pages located in `src/app/auth`.
- **Core Database Schema**: The `prisma/schema.prisma` file defines a basic schema for users, accounts, and sessions, which supports the NextAuth.js authentication flow.
- **Dashboard UI**: The frontend includes a dashboard with UI components for staking, loans, and other user-facing features. However, these are not connected to backend data.

### ⚠️ Implemented, But Requires Testing & Refinement

- **Staking Interface**: The staking UI at `src/app/dashboard/staking` is visually implemented but operates entirely on mock data (`StakingInterface.tsx`). It is not connected to any backend services and does not reflect the required multi-chain functionality.
- **Backend Liquidity API**: The Go backend has API endpoints for liquidity pools (`/api/pools`), but the service logic in `backend/pkg/liquidity/service.go` consists of placeholders that do not interact with any blockchain or database.
- **Authentication Flow**: While NextAuth.js is configured, the end-to-end authentication flow, particularly wallet connections and session management for blockchain interactions, requires rigorous testing and refinement.
- **Onboarding Logic**: The UI for user onboarding is present, but the critical background processes, such as the creation of a Hedera DID and a smart account on Base, are not implemented.

### ❌ Not Implemented or Missing

- **BNPL Technical Flow**: The entire core Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) business logic is absent from the codebase. This includes:
  - Real-time credit check functionality.
  - Hedera HTS NFT loan agreement creation.
  - Hedera Consensus Service (HCS) integration for recording events.
  - The Go relayer service responsible for sending LayerZero messages.
- **Smart Contracts**: There are no smart contracts for Hedera, EVM chains (Base, Arbitrum, etc.), or LayerZero in the `contracts` directory.
- **LayerZero Integration**: The cross-chain interoperability layer, intended to be handled by LayerZero, has not been implemented.
- **Staking Functionality (End-to-End)**: The staking feature is non-functional. The backend logic is placeholder, and the database schema in `prisma/schema.prisma` is missing the required tables for `liquidity_pools` and `user_investments`.
- **Credit Scoring Engine**: The `backend/pkg/creditscore` directory exists, but it does not contain any functional credit scoring logic.
- **Multi-Chain Integration**: The architecture for interacting with the specified EVM and non-EVM chains (Base, Arbitrum, Solana, etc.) is not implemented.
- **Test Suites**: The project lacks any test files for the frontend or the backend.
